## AI Student repository
This is your AI class repository.   

The repository is used to provide you with the code for the programming exercises.
Please make sure to check in your code BEFORE the *deadline*.
Your code will be evaluated based on automatic tests, the results will be available in your exercise folder.

The exercises are provided in directories named "e<twoDigits>\_<exerciseName>".
**Do not create folders using these names!**

Inside these directories there is a file named "ex\_<exerciseName>.py", this is the template for the exercise.  
**Use this file to hand in your solution!**

**Use Python 2.7**

## Git Workflow
- Clone your (this) repository (only the first time) 
```
$ git clone git@animal.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de:ai_lecture/group_<GroupNumber>.git
```

- Fetch commits from the remote repo and merge any changes. 
```
$ git pull
```

- Check for changes in your working directory.
```
$ git status
```

- Add all new files to the staging area.
```
$ git add . 
```

- Commit all changes to the local repository.
```
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

- Push your commits to the remote repository.
```
$ git push
```

**For the evaluation we will only consider code that was pushed to the remote repository before the deadline**
